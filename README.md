Security Training VM and Roadmap with tools


It’s practical, safe to run in your isolated lab (Kali + target VM), and includes everything you need to hit the goals: concise study material, lab exercises, step-by-step tasks, three ready-to-run scripts (with code), a README (usage + safety), a 4-week timeline, and an assessment rubric.

I. Quick orientation (what to do first)

Run this work only inside your lab VMs (the sec-lab you already built or any isolated VMs).

Do not scan or probe anything you don’t own or have written permission to test. The port scanner included only scans the IPs/ports you explicitly supply (or 127.0.0.1 by default).

Save everything to a Git repo inside your lab (e.g., /home/vagrant/sec-month1) so you can snapshot and revert easily.
